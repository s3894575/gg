  <h1>Profile</h1>
  <p> Hello my name is Benjamin</p>
  
  <h1>Background<h1>
<p>My name is Benjamin Wakyereza and Iâ€™m born in Uganda where I lived my childhood years. I arrived in Melbourne Australia when I was turning thirteen years of age and I have lived there ever since. Arriving in Australia this young meant that I could start the high school experience right along with my peers which meant that I could assimilate to the culture more easily. Unfortunately though not surprising this also meant that I would lose my speaking proficiency of Luganda which is my mother tongue over the years, even though I can understand it perfectly. While in school I was playing soccer at every opportunity, not even the playing I did for my club would quench my hunger for the game.

Throughout my life, I have had a progression of hobbies, starting from playing video games all day, movies, trying out musical instruments( i.e; piano and Guitar), reading books to knowing everything about cars and many more in between. At the moment I am trying to explore my dancing abilities with the PlanetShakers dance crew.

I graduated high school with the class of 2020 and received the VCE-Baccalaureate certificate. As a result I am currently a student at RMIT university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. As my final year of high school was winding up, I was increasingly realising that I want to have a career in the Technology industry. This was partly because of many reasons.
